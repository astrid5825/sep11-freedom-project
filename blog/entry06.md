## Presenting in the Expo
It made me very nervous to present second in the expo, but it was fun to show off and talk about my project. I got to let the judges play it while I was explaining, which (in my opinion) helped them ask questions about my project. It's simple compaired to the ones next to it, but I am still proud of what I did because I don't see anyone else with my concept. I think the judges liked my work, and I enjoyed talking to them and answering their questions about my project.
