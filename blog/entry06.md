## Presenting in the Expo
It made me very nervous to present second in the expo, but it was fun to show off and talk about my project. I got to let the judges play it while I was explaining, which (in my opinion) helped them ask questions about my project. It's simple compaired to the ones next to it, but I am still proud of what I did because I don't see anyone else with my concept. I think the judges liked my work, and I enjoyed talking to them and answering their questions about my project.

## Presenting in class
I got the double whammie of presenting the same day as the expo, but in my opinion this one went a lot better. I felt more comfortable being able to better explain my process through images on the slides. The only thing I noticed myself doing in the presentation was sway back and forth, I need to work on that. But it was still a lot more fun and went a lot better than doing an elevator pitch, I still enjoyed showing off my work and my process and the feedback people gave me through questions was nice.
