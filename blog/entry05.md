# My MVP
So, I scrapped the background entirely. I haven't built the actually mechanics for my game, so I started on that.

When you touch "your friend", the game ends. Everytime you refresh the page, the sprite you have to touch is in a random position. This would be my first "MVP"

I also added text to tell the player what they needed to do.

I don't know if I even want a backdrop/levels anymore. My new idea was to randomize sprites/blocks so when you refresh, you get a new scene every time. 

I want to give a shout out to the [Kaboom playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add). I was able to get the text + randomizer from there.
